# Assignment 2 - Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating control structures:

## Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
- Prints the result.

**File:** `even_odd_checker.py`

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
- Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers 1 to 50.
- Calculates and prints the sum of these numbers.

**File:** `sum_1_to_50.py`

Tested using Python 3. Run these scripts in a terminal or any Python IDE.
